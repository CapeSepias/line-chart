    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>We've chosen npm as our primary distribution system. The reason is simple: Bower forced us to version the build files, which was annoying when reviewing/merging pull requests. We don't like annoying things.</p>
    <p>The library is still in beta, which means it's not accessible through npm without specifying its version. Install it using the following command:</p>
    <p><code>$ npm install n3-charts@2.0.0-beta23 --save-dev</code></p>

    <p>Work in progress. Back in the days, you'd have found an epilepsy-yellowish gif with a tiny worker shoveling shit here. Check out our cool <a href="#/examples">examples</a> meanwhile !</p>
