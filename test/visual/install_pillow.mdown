## On Mac OS 10.9.2

#### Do not try to install PIL
Seriously. It might be valid on other platforms (oh sweet Jesus playing bagpipe in a bunker I miss Debian), but it seems to be deprecated, at least on OS X.

#### Install pip

```
sudo easy_install pip
```

#### Install Pillow

```
export CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments
export CPPFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments
sudo -E pip install pillow
```

The first two lines and the `-E` flag are there to prevent some obscure `gcc` error/warning I really don't give a flying fart about.

## On Linux
Come on. I figured out to install that on a Mac, don't tell me you got here without knowing how to use `apt`.


## On Windows
I'll pretend you didn't ask that.
